static block and constructor:

constructor are used to initialize the objects.

--> for every class, there will be a default constructor, whenever we create an object constructor will be called , then object will be created.

--> Constructor having class name and method properties


Static block:


public class q2{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Demo d1=new Demo();
		Demo d2=new Demo();
			}
		}
class Demo{
static{
	System.out.println("static block");
	}
Demo(){
	System.out.println("constructor");
	}



--> static block can be created with "static" keyword
--> it will be called automatically
--> no need to call, either object or class

-->for static method, no need to call with object you can directly call with class name and here static will act as instance (or) object
